# Community Overview

![](../../.gitbook/assets/community%20%281%29.jpg)

As you will see in the next few sections, we have a literal megaton of stuff for you to enjoy in X-Team. Please, dig in and go wild! Just remember that all of this is here solely to entertain and energize you. It's not supposed to be a chore, and it's _absolutely not mandatory_ to participate in any of these things! Though we do hope you'll find something you like :\)

And if you think of something good we could add to the list, let us know!

## Seasons

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th80vOGFvUE" caption="" %}

The X-Team community is truly unlike any other. We've built the most energizing community for developers and continue to make it more and more awesome every Season.

Seasons are three-month adventures we embark on as a community.

We created Seasons at X-Team to remind ourselves of the freedom we have, to wake up each day excited and energized and ready to come alive by doing more of what we love, to remind us to live a life we would live over and over again for eternity.

They're about pushing you to grow and explore, to do more of the things that make you feel alive, and to feed off the energy that comes from a massive community of people doing that every day.

Each Season is made up of a unique set of **Bounties**, **Vault** rewards, **X-Outposts**, **Game Days**, **Unleash+** expansions and more.

Let's dive into each of those.

## **Bounties**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-05-10%20at%203.42.50%20PM.png)

One of the main things you can do each season is chase [**Bounties.**](https://github.com/x-team/handbook/tree/480c308775fd27376ae7ec3121be0d6dacf565de/xhq.x-team.com/bounties/README.md)

Bounties are challenges designed to help energize you, to do more of the things you already love to do and give you that greater sense of wellbeing.

Bounties could be things like reaching a certain level in a video game or watching one of Guillermo Del Toro's favorite movies, or running somewhere rather than driving there, or maybe going on a road trip.

There's really something for everyone every season and the energy and inspiration that comes from everyone doing bounties is really like nothing you've seen before.

**How It Works:** [Go to the Bounties page](https://github.com/x-team/handbook/tree/480c308775fd27376ae7ec3121be0d6dacf565de/xhq.x-team.com/bounties/README.md), pick one, and off you go, bounty hunter. Report completion as specified in the description, and earn your coins you can use in [The Vault.](https://github.com/x-team/handbook/tree/480c308775fd27376ae7ec3121be0d6dacf565de/xhq.x-team.com/vault/README.md)

If you have an idea for a new bounty, let [@ben](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/x-team/x-team-remote-developer-guide-to-greatness/edit#) know, and he'll help you get it into the next season, if at all possible.

## The Vault

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-05-10%20at%203.48.14%20PM.png)

Now what's cool about Bounties is they earn you coins that you can use in [**The Vault**](https://github.com/x-team/handbook/tree/480c308775fd27376ae7ec3121be0d6dacf565de/xhq.x-team.com/vault/README.md), which is our exclusive collectibles store.

And we enlist artists and creators from around the world to help design some beautiful and meaningful clothing and collectibles.

[**The Vault**](https://github.com/x-team/handbook/tree/480c308775fd27376ae7ec3121be0d6dacf565de/xhq.x-team.com/vault/README.md) really is a celebration of all the things that energize us, from geek culture to programming and all these things we're passionate about.

You can even donate your coins to each Season's Spotlight Charities or any cause you support, which so far has led to thousands of dollars going to a lot of incredible causes.

## Game Days

Once a week we all come together as a community to play an X-Team exclusive game or competition.

It could be [**VS**](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/CGK10CSLU/), a race where we're competing as teams to rack up the most steps in a day:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-05-10%20at%203.51.51%20PM.png)

Or it could be a Heist where we have to go collect things in the real world.

Or it could be a [Loot Raid](https://github.com/x-team/handbook/tree/480c308775fd27376ae7ec3121be0d6dacf565de/xhq.x-team.com/raids/README.md) where we're dice rolling against bosses for big prizes:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-05-10%20at%204.03.32%20PM.png)

The list goes on, but we're always excited to open up our laptops each day to find out what's next.

## [X-Outposts](https://github.com/x-team/handbook/tree/480c308775fd27376ae7ec3121be0d6dacf565de/x-outpost.com)

The X-Outpost is our famous hacker-house that any X-Teamer can go visit. It changes locations about 3 times every Season, so there's always somewhere new in the world you can go live and work with other X-Teamers and go on adventures together on the weekends if you so desire.

Everyone who goes to an X-Outpost is just infused with energy the entire time they're there.

## [Unleash+](https://github.com/x-team/handbook/tree/480c308775fd27376ae7ec3121be0d6dacf565de/xhq.x-team.com/unleash/README.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-05-10%20at%203.56.46%20PM.png)

Every Season we're also always unlocking new ways to use our [**Unleash+**](https://github.com/x-team/handbook/tree/480c308775fd27376ae7ec3121be0d6dacf565de/xhq.x-team.com/unleash/README.md) membership that we offer to X-Teamers who work with our partners.

[**Unleash+**](https://github.com/x-team/handbook/tree/480c308775fd27376ae7ec3121be0d6dacf565de/xhq.x-team.com/unleash/README.md) comes with a $2,500/year allowance to spend on a bunch of energizing activities that help X-Teamers learn, grow, explore and do more of the things they love.

Whether it's a gym membership to get you active, a babysitter to help you get out, video games to bring you new adventures, better headphones to help you stay productive, a MasterClass to explore something you love, Unleash+ is really the ultimate tool to staying energized and it keeps getting better each Season.

Seasons are really all about bringing energy into your life, bringing adventure & exploration & helping you always be moving forward.

### Clubs

Clubs are channels with specialized topics, where there is at least some degree of organized activity. Clubs occasionally run activities, where it is also possible to earn [X-Coins](https://github.com/x-team/handbook/tree/480c308775fd27376ae7ec3121be0d6dacf565de/onboarding-guide/technicalities/technicalities.md#XTC).
