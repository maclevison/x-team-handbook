## Community

We keep stressing that X-Team is a community of like-minded people who want to see the world proper and make it a better place. But it being a community — how does that actually show?

Well, there are several elements to it...

### Slack

You know Slack. Everyone knows Slack. We spend ungodly hours on it — because we want to and it's fun, not because we have to — and there's always something fun to do. If you're interested in just about anything, chances are, we have a channel for it with people who share that interest. You can look up the list of existing channels in slack or [here](slack_channels.md), if you're only interested in the most popular ones, but what do you do if your favorite pastime isn't on it?

Ping [@Luis](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/ULCRZLN95) and tell him that the impossible happened. Explain what your hobby/interest is and that you'd love to share it with the community. He'll get you sorted with instructions on how to do it, get you feedback on potential previous experience with it from the Core Team, and once everything is ready, he'll help you get this new little piece of heaven announced to the community via our announcements channel.

You can also get an idea [in this guide](community-guardian-guide.md) of what it's like leading a Slack group by becoming a Community Guardian.

### Community Initiatives

We have a ton of community initiatives going on. Actually, by the end of 2017, we had so many, that we had to cut back. This is why we decided to reorganize and have kicked off in 2018 with a new structure... Which we have overhauled again in 2019, to bring you...

#### Seasons

Seasons are 2-3-month-long periods where the community is abuzz with new bounties \(see below\), new Unleash+ reimbursement possibilities, new challenges, and a new energy boost. That is also when your suggestions for new bounties or vault items \(talk to [@Luis](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/ULCRZLN95) about those\) may be brought to life.

#### Bounties

Instead of previous, more structured but more complex challenges, now we give you the straightforward [bounties](https://xhq.x-team.com/bounties). Go to the page, pick one \(or fifteen\), and off you go, bounty hunter! Report completion as specified in the description, and earn your coins!

If you have an idea for a new bounty, let [@Luis](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/ULCRZLN95) know, and he'll help you get it into the next season, if at all possible.

#### Clubs

Clubs are channels with specialized topics, where there is at least some degree of organized activity. Clubs occasionally run activities, where it is also possible to earn [X-Coins](./).

Current examples thereof are:

* [Yoga Club](http://community.x-team.com/yoga) — [\#yoga](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C76CK2VU2)
* [Game Club](http://community.x-team.com/games) — [\#game-club](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C3WV9FYGJ)
* [Photography Club](http://community.x-team.com/photography) — [\#photography-club](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C79JCSBPH)
* [Cycling Club](http://community.x-team.com/cycling) — [\#cycling-club](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C740KNBPA)
* [Haskell Learning Club](http://community.x-team.com/clubs/#haskell-learning-club) —[\#haskell-learning-club](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C8T6XRZRV)

As with anything else community-related, if you would like to start another club, or if you just have an idea for one, talk to [@Luis](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/ULCRZLN95).
