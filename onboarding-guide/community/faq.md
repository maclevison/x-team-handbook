# FAQ

\(This section is being continuously updated as new questions come up, so check back soon!\)

* **I read the whole guide front to back and back to front, including this FAQ, and I still don't understand X!** Talk to [@Luis](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/ULCRZLN95). Either he has the answer, or he'll get it for you.
* **I'm waiting for the meeting with my Account Manager \(if you're not sure who that is, ask @luke\) and the partner team. What am I supposed to do meanwhile?** Relax, have a look around slack, join [channels that attract your attention](https://x-team.com/missions/slack/), have a chat with your fellow X-Teamers and enjoy. You will get the project-specific onboarding at the meeting with your account manager and the partner team at the meeting which you've probably already been invited to â€” if you haven't, talk to your account manager, i.e. the person responsible for your team \(if you are not sure who that is, ask @luke, and he'll point you in the right direction\).
* **Wow... Do I actually** _**have to**_ **participate in all that?** Don't worry, you are not expected to take part in everything that's going on. That would be almost impossible. We do like seeing our developers take part in our community initiatives, but they aren't supposed to be a burden, so if you don't have the time, don't worry about it. We do often reward participation with coins which you can exchange for swag, donations, etc. though, so think about it.
* **How do I know how many coins I have?** Check out XHQ - click on your avatar in the top-right.
* **I have coins! Can I get the swag menu, please?** Absolutely. Check [The Vault](https://xhq.x-team.com/vault) and place your order.
* **So, I have this friend who's a great coder, experienced and currently looking...** Excellent! Introduce him to Caleb, and he'll take it from there. If your friend gets in, you'll even get a referral bonus!
* **How do I find people from country X?** There is a good chance they can be reached if you ping the @geo-\[country\] tag.
* **I see X-Team has a blog. Can I get my blogs published there?**  
  Yes, you can. Talk to @Thomas, and he'll get you sorted with all the necessary proofreading, editing, and finally publishing support.

  And just so you know why it's really worth doing it:

  * We'll feature the blog in the weekly newsletter with more than 25,000 subscribers.
  * We'll promote the blog across the web.
  * You'll have a personal editor available to help you polish your piece into something you'll be proud to show off not only content- but also language-wise.

  Quite a deal, isn't it ;\)

* **I'm applying for a visa and need my employer details. What do I put down?** When applying for visas, to prevent potential problems with immigration officials, keep in mind that you shouldn't use the terminology "employee" and "employer" when referring to X-Team since, legally, contracting is different from employment, and the immigration officials could misunderstand your claim as a lie and reject your visa application and/or deny you entry - possibly permanently.

  We're happy to provide documentation that confirms our past, ongoing, and projected business relationship, if this would help you with acquiring the visa, however. If you need such documentation, talk to @brad, and he'll get you sorted.
