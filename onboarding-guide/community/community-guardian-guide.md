# Community Guardian Guide

So, you're interested in starting up a group in the X-Team Community? Perhaps we're missing a group that focuses on your passions and motivating you \(and others\) to explore those passions more often.

Then prepare to become an **X-Team Guardian.**

Every channel in X-Team's Slack community \(as well other initiatives like X-Outposts or conferences we sponsor\) has a Guardian, someone dedicated to **keeping it moving forward.**

As a Guardian, you might find yourself doing any of these things:

* Creating challenges
* Mentoring others
* Hosting events \(online or offline\)
* Creating competitions
* etc.

### Getting started

Regardless of whether you want to create a study group or perhaps a Hearthstone club, you are completely empowered to do so.

But also know that the [Core Team](community-guardian-guide.md) is here to support you in a few different ways:

* **Want your group to make a charitable impact?** We can help motivate your group via a Group Goal that results in a donation to a charity or open source project.
* **Want your group to earn X-Coins?** We will help you reward your group with X-Coins for completing activities or challenges you create.
* **Want to promote your group or any of its activities?** We have access to the almighty [\#x-announcements](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C0257R0RV/) channel, as well as the [XHQ](https://xhq.x-team.com) where we can help promote your group's activities to the community at large.
* **Want help keeping your group engaged?** If your group is turning into a ghost town, we can use our years of expertise to help you find ways to spark the fire again for your group.
* **Want your group to utilize the Unleash Budget in a new way?** We're always open to new ways for X-Teamers to use the Unleash+ Budget to reimburse to help them grow around their goals and passions.

Ping [@Luis](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/ULCRZLN95) on Slack to get help implementing any of those ideas and get your channel created and running.

### X-Outpost Guardians

If you're interested in becoming an X-Outpost Guardian \(think: local guide/host for a group of ~6 X-Teamers\), check out the [X-Outpost Guide](../../x-outpost-guide/).

## Top Tips for Slack Groups

While there is no "right" way of being a successful Guardian, we have learned a lot from those who came before you and will share some tips below on how to set up your group for success.

### 1. **Understand how motivation works.**

People are naturally motivated to do things they enjoy and that represent what they believe in.

**For example:** If you believe your health is important, you're naturally motivated to want to go to the gym and eat healthy. In fact, you enjoy doing those things.

**But you might get caught up in life and work and forget to make the time for going to the gym and eating healthy.**

This is where a group setting combined with motivating reminders can help you maintain the habits that you enjoy.

Think of your new group as a place where people share about a shared passion and, in doing so, remind one another to engage in that activity more often.

**You can also create these reminders via activities like: challenges, events, tournaments, Hangouts, meetups, etc.**

It's really up to you and your group how you want to do it, but here are some examples:

* **Fit-Quest** uses a game with weekly challenges to remind fitness lovers to get out to the gym or out for a run.
* **Cycling Club** uses a monthly challenge with a group km goal to reach to reminder cyclers to go for more rides.
* **Game Club** has a monthly tournament in an old school game \(like UT2k4\) to remind gamers to take a break and play games more.
* **Unleash Quests** uses a weekly lesson approach to learn something new and create to remind devs how much they love learning and creating.

### 2. Use Pinned posts for newcomers

When someone new joins your group, they will feel very lost without some helpful information on how to get started.

We like using pinned posts \(and making a mention of them in the channel description\) that explain how everything in your group works.

### 3. Async vs. realtime

There are two ways your group can engage with one another: **asynchronously** or in **realtime**. Or even both.

**The most effective method we've found is asynchronous communication**. Why? People join remote teams because of the flexibility and they often avoid any sort of realtime interaction unless it's convenient to them \(which it rarely is with 10 timezones\).

Realtime communication is also effective, but it's **more difficult to coordinate.**

The best way to find out what your group prefers is to simply ask them via a poll \(/poll in Slack\). See how they want to engage and collaborate and then design your activities around their preference.

Examples:

* **Game Club** combines async and realtime with async game reviews, but also async + realtime tournaments where 2 players face off in realtime while others await and schedule other matches asynchronously. This allows for a great balance of the two, and only requires 2 people at a time to be available for realtime interaction.
* **Productivity Quest, Yoga Club, Fit-Quest**, etc. are all entirely asynchronous to allow everyone to try out methods and exercises on their own time.

### 4. Challenges

One of the most effective ways to remind a group of passionate people to do something they love is through Challenges.

A great challenge has these characteristics:

1. **Simple to accomplish in a couple of hours at most.** The less the time commitment, the more effective it will be.
2. **Produces an end result that can be shared.** When everyone can share what they achieved/created via photo, video, code, etc., it serves as incredible motivation to others to get involved since they have a vision of what completing the challenge looks and feels like. ![](https://github.com/x-team/x-team-remote-developer-guide-to-greatness/tree/9523a64ad688c0b134f0c35dd788ad8393cc5046/assets/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2018-01-26&#32;at&#32;8.30.04&#32;PM.png)
3. **Taps into joy.** Think about the difference between a challenge to read or watch a lot of guides vs. jump in and build something based on a quick lesson. You want to tap as quickly as possible into what really motivates your group to be passionate about something -- with programmers, creating is where the joy and fun lies, so find ways to quickly get to creating.

Other types of challenges include Tournaments, which we found [Challonge.com](http://challonge.com) great for registering challengers and creating tournament brackets.

Challenges are even more effective when there's a reward involved. Ping [@Luis](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/ULCRZLN95) on Slack to get support for x-coins ![](../../.gitbook/assets/coin.png) rewards or a charitable donation reward.

### 5. Group challenges

Individual challenges are great because they allow everyone in the group to go at their own pace.

But you should also consider group challenges where they depend on each other in order to succeed. Sometimes, these types of challenges allow X-Teamers to unleash their compassion and team spirit in ways like never before.

Group challenge examples include trying to bike a collective group total of kilometers in a month, or trying to get everyone to submit a PR to an open source project in order to achieve the goal \(and prize if applicable\).

### 6. Limit challenges/activities to 2 per week

We've found that people only have time for so much in their busy lives, and if they're participating in multiple groups at one time, at best you'll be able to get them to participate in 2 challenges/activities/events/etc. per week.

But feel free to experiment and see what works best for you group. Perhaps 3 times/week is better, or perhaps once a week, or perhaps open ended at any time in the month.

### 7. Consider streak rewards

One great way to get people coming back to your channel and engaging consistently is by offering some sort of Streak bonus for engaging consecutively.

For example, in **Fit-Quest**, a 4-week Streak was rewarded by 3 x-coins ![](../../.gitbook/assets/coin.png).

In **Productivity Quest**, Streaks exponentially increased the total number of trees \(via [Retree](http://retree.com)\) we have planted around the world by the end of the season.
