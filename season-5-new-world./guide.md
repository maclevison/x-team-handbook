## War of the NeXus

The War of the NeXus is a brand new metagame that will be running throughout X-Team’s Season 5. A grand struggle between the three Houses - Steelfire, Nightclaw and the Lions Pride - to claim dominance of a brand new planet in the X-Team universe.   


Over the course of three months, players will explore this wild planet, extract rare resources where they find them, expand their territories by constructing bases and defences, and exterminate their opponents in fast paced dice based combat.   


Only one House can win. **But what can you do to take part?**  


## Events

**VS:** These are events where the three Houses, Steelfire, Nightclaw and the Lions Pride all face off against each other in a 24 hour long team based competition.   


![Just one example of a VS competition.](../.gitbook/assets/banner2.png)

  
Sometimes they will be competing to see who can log the most steps in one day, or who can get the highest combined score in an arcade game.   
  
The goal may change, but the hype is always the same.  
  
For examples of past VS Events and to take part in others, visit:  [https://app.slack.com/client/T0257R0RP/CGK10CSLU](https://app.slack.com/client/T0257R0RP/CGK10CSLU)   
  
  
**Loot Raids:** These are events where the Houses square off against powerful Raid Bosses for Coins and Prizes!   


![These insects needed squashed.](../.gitbook/assets/loot-raid.png)

  
The Raiders will take it in turns to roll damage dice via \(Slack and XHQ \) to deal damage and defeat the Raid Boss in an hour long battle filled with thrills, spills and a healthy dose of memes.

Every Raid is different, with new mechanics, new bosses and new loot! So you never quite know what you're going to face.   
  
Past prizes have been TVs, Games Consoles, Drones and Coffee Machines, so be sure to check it out if you want a chance to walk away with some hefty loot.

**Fireside:** These events are your opportunity to chill out, chat and play some games with the X-Team Community.  


![](../.gitbook/assets/banner.png)

  
Firesides take place over a big Zoom call, where we can all get some face time to talk about recent news or upcoming events, exciting developments or anything that comes to mind. Then we play some games to win coins and have some laughs.   
  
They are relaxed affairs, with no signups required, no camera needed and freedom to come and go as you please.
