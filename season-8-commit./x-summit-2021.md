## Rebellious \(iOS/Android\)

_Rebellious_ is our first-ever, open world mobile app -- available now on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rebellious-impact/id1583931094) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rdgames.xscifi).

**Lore:** _Rebellious_ takes you to Avarus City, a city in the future ruled by the corrupt mega-conglomerate known as ShadowCorp. Self expression is considered a war crime in Avarus, and any products found by drones that aren't made by ShadowCorp get locked away in an underground facility known as..._**The Vault.**_ \(Yes, _that_ Vault\).

In _Rebellious_, you can:

* Collect [**Vault Drops**](x-summit-2021.md#rebellious-vault-drops) to earn all-new X-Team collectible loot
* Collect all **16 Data Shards** to become an [XLBL Early Adopter](x-summit-2021.md#xlbl-early-adopter-access)
* Collect coins by hacking **ATMs** or collecting & selling **Parts** from the streets**.**
* Spend your coins on: 
  * **Weapon upgrades** \(find the dealer in the Solum District\)
  * **Spray paint** \(find the spray paint dealer in any District\) to tag walls with your House sigil and increase your House's reputation
* Explore and discover more secrets & rewards in the streets of Avarus...

## Rebellious: Vault Drops

![Vault drops can be found twice per day in the Rebellious app. Watch for app notifications.](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2875%29.png)

At the [Opening Ceremony](x-summit-2021.md#opening-ceremony), dozens of Vault drops -- _containing all-new, unreleased X-Team collectibles_ --  descended into Avarus City in the most historic Vault drop of all time. 

Until 24.9.21, **those same drops will continue repeating** sporadically throughout the 3 districts in Avarus \(Centralis, Solum and Vilicus\). The teleporter to the other districts can be found by following the arrow on your in-app screen.

Keep your eyes on [\#x-summit-21](https://app.slack.com/client/T0257R0RP/C02DEDYHR8X) and in Avarus itself for clues on when certain drops might happen.

Here's a look at some of the dozens of new drops if you missed them:

## Rebellious: Smuggler Drops

With Avarus alive again thanks to the rebellion bringing self expression back into the city, the city has attracted smugglers looking to sell even more contraband to citizens, **ranging from rare collectibles \(some even autographed!\) to high-end gadgets, apparel and beyond.**

Smugglers acquire goods by stealing from the ShadowCorp elite who have Vault connections. Examples:

**Here's how smuggler drops work every day until 24.9.21:**

* **Vote in** [**\#x-summit-21**](https://app.slack.com/client/T0257R0RP/C02DEDYHR8X) on which smuggler \(of 20+\) you want to help escort into the city.
* **Gain intel on when and where** the chosen smuggler will arrive. Each smuggler brings a different challenge to learn their whereabouts.
* **Find the smuggler**, pay them their fee \(using Rebellious coins\), and you'll get your shot at claiming their goods...

Check in each day in [\#x-summit-21](https://app.slack.com/client/T0257R0RP/C02DEDYHR8X) for the many ways for you to gain access to smugglers, from tagging walls in the city for your House, to playing the all-new HackBreak, and beyond.
