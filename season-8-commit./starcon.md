## The Arena: Alien

![](../.gitbook/assets/the-arena-alien.-1-.png)

The dark and claustrophobic battlefield of the USCSS Nostromo awaits you for this special edition of our favorite Slack-based battle royale game - The Arena.

Scarce options and not a lot of places to run to and hide. A powerful Xenomorph is on the loose hunting its prey - you. Hold your breath, walk in the shadows and don't make any noise, the alien might be right behind you at all times and in space no one can hear you scream.

Become the sole survivor in order to activate and use the only escape pod not damaged when the Watchman's Spaceship crashed into the Nostromo.

The winner will also receive an exclusive vault item.

### X-Worlds: Draw Your Alien

![](../.gitbook/assets/x-worlds-draw-your-alien.gif)

Created to foster and appreciate the creativity and greatness of the currently smallest future X-Teamers in the world, this activity was designed as a way to generate a fun and energizing quality time between X-Teamers and the children they support either through family bonds, community service or other means.

The adult will be asked to explain basic concepts like the planets in our solar system or how many moons Jupiter has - anything that can easily be captured by the child to spark their curiosity - and then prompt them to come up with and draw their own interpretation of how alien species would look like.

The submissions will be voted with reactions by the community - always with care, love and appreciation - and we will ask for the official X-Team artists to transform some of the children's vision into amazing artworks to be added to an exclusive design to be released on the Vault after StarCon.

Make sure to avoid telling the children about the prize!  
Let's make it a surprise for them. ![:heart:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/google-medium/2764-fe0f@2x.png)

## Unleash+

Unleash+ is your $2,500 per year budget to spend toward activities and gear that energize you. Use it this event to spark your curiosity and to acquire new knowledge to keep you moving forward.

The featured categories for StarCon are:

* **Courses and Books**: never stop learning by getting an online course or book in any topic.
* **Scholarship**: sponsor someone's learning and growth.
* **Unleash Your Family**: courses, tools and apps to empower your children's maker spirit.

But feel free to explore all the other options in this universe of energy and excitement. ![:smiley:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/google-medium/1f603@2x.png)

## Trivia Dungeon Livestream

![](../.gitbook/assets/image-1-.png)

StarCon will end in a livestream event with the special participation of an amazing scientist for a Q&A, a fun trivia game to support a special cause and much much more.

We will be offering support to the[ Astronomical Camp 2021 in Poland](https://oboz.almukantarat.pl/) in order to allow it to receive more people and hopefully inspire a new generation of explorers.
